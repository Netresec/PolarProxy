# Rulesets for PolarProxy
[PolarProxy]{https://www.netresec.com/?page=PolarProxy} can be used as a TLS firewall by providing a ruleset that defines match conditions and corresponding actions.

The rule based logic is activated by starting PolarProxy with `--ruleset FILE`, where `FILE` can be either a path or a URL to a ruleset file. 

For more information about the ruleset format, see [PolarProxy TLS Firewall](https://www.netresec.com/?page=TlsFirewall).
